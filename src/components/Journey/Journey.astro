        I am Jessie Abrahamson and I started right here in Oak Harbor WA working
        for David and Nadya Flynn back in 1998 since they owned Gyros R Us Cafe,
        which then became Flynn's Greek House, and before I took over the
        business - Nadyas Greek Cuisine. I went out with them at all the
        festivals, then ultimately I decided to buy my first food truck in 2006.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        I have been running the food truck ever since. But in 2018 Nadya
        announced to me she was retiring from the business and we talked about
        taking it over for her - after all, I have been with her since the
        beginning.

        So in January 2019 me and my partner Chris officially bought the
        restaurant I grew up working in and moved the name from the food truck
        to the new location. That's how AB's Hillbilly Gyros came to Oak Harbor.
